TITLE: AI-Powered Drone Vision for Smart Construction: Crack Detection, Safety Monitoring, and Predictive Maintenance

Abstract :
This research presents an AI-enhanced, drone-supported approach for automated crack detection, classification, segmentation, and estimation of construction materials. By utilizing deep learning models, including LeNet for classifying cracks, U-Net for segmentation, and YOLOv8 for real-time detection, the system significantly improves the accuracy of structural monitoring. Image preprocessing through OpenCV aids in better defect recognition, while a predictive modeling component anticipates fracture development to facilitate preventive maintenance. Furthermore, a material estimation module assesses the requirements for building materials based on input from the user. Drones outfitted with high-definition cameras to record in real time data from the site, enabling rapid analysis. The system operates on the Django framework, offering an easy-to-navigate web interface. This cohesive system enhances construction monitoring, structural assessment, and safety for workers by minimizing the need for manual inspections.
